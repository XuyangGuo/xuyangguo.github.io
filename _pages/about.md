Projects
=========
* 2020.7 - 2021.6, Portrait Relighting
  * 2012 Lab, **HUAWEI**
  * Re-lighting with a single portrait image in any target lighting direction. 
  * To achieve realistic and available effect, we desgin a two-stage solution 1) 3D reconstruction for diffuse rendering; 2) GAN network fine-tuning.
